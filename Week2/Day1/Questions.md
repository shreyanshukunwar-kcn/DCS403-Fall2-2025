# 🧮 C++ Conditional Statement Practice Questions

This document contains programming exercises to help you understand and practice different **decision-making statements** in C++ — including `if`, `if-else`, `if-else ladder`, `nested if`, `ternary operator`, and `switch` statements.

---

## 🔹 1. If Statement

### 🧩 Question:
**Write a program to check if a number is positive.**

**Hint:**
Use a simple `if` condition to check whether the number is greater than 0.

**Expected Logic:**
```cpp
if (num > 0) {
    cout << "Positive number";
}
```



---

## 🔹2. If-Else Statement

### 🧩 Question:
**Write a program to find the greater of two numbers.**

### 💡 Hint:
Use an `if-else` condition to compare the two numbers.


---

## 🔹 3. If-Else Ladder Statement

### 🧩 Question:
**Write a program to assign grades based on marks (A, B, C, F).**

### 💡 Condition Table:

| Marks Range | Grade |
|--------------|--------|
| 80–100 | A |
| 60–79 | B |
| 40–59 | C |
| Below 40 | F |



---

## 🔹 4. Nested If Statement

### 🧩 Question:
**Write a program to check if a number is:**
- Positive and Even  
- Positive and Odd  
- Negative  
- Zero  

### 💡 Hint:
Use a nested `if` structure to test multiple conditions.


---

## 🔹 5. Ternary Operator

### 🧩 Question:
**Use a ternary operator to find the smaller of two numbers.**

### 💡 Hint:
The ternary operator syntax is:
```cpp
(condition) ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false;
```

# 🧭 6. Day of the Week using Switch Statement

## 🎯 Objective
Write a C++ program that prints the **name of the day of the week** based on a number entered by the user (1–7).

---

## 🧩 Problem Description
The user will input a number between **1 and 7**.  
Your program should print the corresponding day name using a **switch-case statement**.

If the input is **outside this range**, display a message:  
> Invalid day number!
