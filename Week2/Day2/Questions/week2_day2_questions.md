```
a
```
**Expected Output:**
```
Uppercase: A
```

---

### **Question 3:**
Write a program to count the number of vowels and consonants in a given string.

**Expected Input:**
```
Hello World
```
**Expected Output:**
```
Vowels: 3
Consonants: 7
```

---

## 🧵 Strings

**Expected Input:**
```
Programming
```
**Expected Output:**
```
Length of string: 11
```

---

### **Question 2:**
Write a program to reverse a string.

**Hint:** Use `reverse(str.begin(), str.end())`.

**Expected Input:**
```
Hello
```
**Expected Output:**
```
Reversed string: olleH

## 🚀 Advanced Practice Questions

### 🧮 **Mathematical Functions**

#### **1. Quadratic Equation Roots**
Write a program to calculate the roots of a quadratic equation
\[
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
\]

**Formula Used:**  
\[
D = b^2 - 4ac
\]  
\[
x_1 = \frac{-b + \sqrt{D}}{2a}, \quad x_2 = \frac{-b - \sqrt{D}}{2a}
\]

**Hint:** Use `sqrt()` and conditional statements for real, equal, or imaginary roots.

**Expected Input:**
```
a = 1, b = -3, c = 2
```
**Expected Output:**
```
Roots are real and distinct: 2 and 1
```

---

#### **2. Distance Between Two Points**
Find the distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\).

**Formula Used:**  
\[
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]

**Expected Input:**
```
x1 = 2, y1 = 3, x2 = 5, y2 = 7
